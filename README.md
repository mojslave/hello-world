# hello-world
This is me and my ideas and excited and willing to learn and listen
I am from New Zealand and I have a full time job though I always have had a real passion for wanting to learn and understand - sometimes this gets the better of me as I expect to know everything all at once and then of course get myself in a right little mess. Im intrested in a wide array of different topics. Video Editing, learning how to properly use command line tools whether that be on my macbook in terminal or with say my dads windows pc with cmd prompt. I want to always be the "go to" person and stedily I am becoming that person in both my family and work colleages as being the "techie one" a nice sentiment im sure although in my darker moments I really feel I know nothing and have not even cracked the surface of all things technology computers networking software hardware arrrrgh just so much and yet this is why im loving starting out because im craving it.
